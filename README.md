# round_robin_speed_dating
Create a Round-Robin styled display out of a csv file, for project speed dating. It ensures students talk to every other student in a minimum amount of rounds. 

A round-robin tournament or all-play-all tournament is a competition format in which each contestant meets every other participant, usually in turn. In a single round-robin schedule, each participant plays every other participant once. In this case, we are using this method for a project Speed Dating, so students can find their final project mates in the minimum amount of rounds.

You will find a sample csv with fictional names to try the function. Keep in mind that the function expects a file with a header, that will be dropped in the process.

Clone the repo, exchange the csv file with yours and run all cells in the Jupyter Notebook.
It will print a set of rounds with its pairings.
